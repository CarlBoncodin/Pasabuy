The rise of online shopping has become increasingly popular due to technological advancements, offering a convenient way for consumers to purchase products from home. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, with lockdowns and restrictions in place, people faced difficulties accessing essential products and services. Traditional online shopping platforms required multiple transactions and deliveries from different stores, causing inconvenience and delays.

Our team identified the need for a more streamlined and efficient online shopping solution that would allow users to purchase products from multiple stores in a single order and receive same-day delivery. The objective was to create a program that would enhance the convenience of online shopping, especially during the pandemic, and provide features such as a senior citizen discount and easy access to various product categories.

Result

The "Pasabuy" project successfully addressed the challenge of managing multiple online orders by integrating them into a single, efficient shopping experience. By developing a Python-based application, we enabled users to order products from various categories—such as food, medicine, groceries, and school supplies—from multiple stores in one transaction. This streamlined process eliminates the need for separate orders and deliveries, making shopping more convenient and efficient, especially during the pandemic. The program features a user-friendly interface with options to view products, manage a cart, and apply senior citizen discounts. It also generates a detailed receipt for each purchase. By utilizing Python's Pandas library for data handling and providing real-time order management, "Pasabuy" enhances online shopping accessibility and user satisfaction, reflecting a significant advancement in e-commerce solutions during challenging times.
